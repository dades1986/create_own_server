# create_own_server

Creating your own application server and incorporating a modular class loading system like jboss-modules is a non-trivial task, as it involves designing a modular architecture, defining class loading mechanisms, managing dependencies, and more. Below are high-level steps you might consider:

1. Understand Your Requirements:
Clearly define the requirements and goals of your application server.
Identify the features and characteristics you want to support.
2. Design Modular Architecture:
Define a modular architecture for your application server.
Determine how you want to organize modules and handle dependencies.
3. Integrate JBoss Modules:
If you want to use jboss-modules, understand its concepts and APIs.
Integrate jboss-modules into your project. You can include it as a dependency using a build tool like Maven or download the JAR manually.
4. Module Descriptors:
Define a format for module descriptors (similar to module.xml in JBoss Modules).
Decide how modules will declare their dependencies, resources, and entry points.
5. Class Loading Logic:
Implement class loading logic based on jboss-modules.
Understand how to load classes dynamically and manage class loading hierarchies.
6. Dependency Resolution:
Implement a mechanism for resolving module dependencies at runtime.
Manage versioning and conflicts between modules.
7. ClassLoader Hierarchy:
Set up a class loader hierarchy similar to the one used in JBoss Modules.
Handle delegation and isolation based on your requirements.
8. Runtime Environment:
Develop the runtime environment for your server.
Consider how modules will be deployed and how your server will handle dynamic updates.
9. Testing:
Implement comprehensive testing for your modular class loading system.
Verify that modules can be loaded, dependencies resolved, and applications run in an isolated manner.
10. Documentation:
Provide clear documentation for developers who want to create modules for your server.
Include information on module descriptors, deployment, and best practices.
11. Community and Support:
If you plan to open-source your server, create a community and support system.
Encourage contributions and feedback.
12. Legal Considerations:
Be aware of any legal considerations when using or modifying jboss-modules if it has a specific license.
13. Iterative Development:
Start with a simple implementation and iterate based on feedback and requirements.
Gradually enhance features and improve performance.
Please note that building an application server is a complex task, and it's important to thoroughly test and validate your implementation. Also, consider using existing solutions or frameworks unless there's a specific need for a custom solution.
